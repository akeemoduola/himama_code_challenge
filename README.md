An important part of the HiMama platform is to allow teachers to clock-in/clock-out of their daycare center. When a teacher arrives to work, they clock-in, when leave they clock-out, and the platform keeps track of these events.

This app is an implementation of the clock-in/clock-out flow of the teachers.

To see a running demo of the app, visit https://lit-ridge-36962.herokuapp.com, 
There are three test users with the following credentials:
* user1 = { email: 'akeem@example.com',
            username: 'Akeem',
            password: 'oakeem123$'
          }

* user2 = { email: 'tolulope@example.com',
            username: 'Tolulope',
            password: 'tolu123$'
          }

* user3 = { email: 'victoria@example.com',
            username: 'Victoria',
            password: '1234567$'
          }

User1 is a teacher that needs to clock-in/clock-out

User2 is also a teacher that needs to clock-in/clock-out

User3 is an admin user that needs to see/edit a list of all timelogs for all users

You can login with either the username/email and the password for each user to test run the app.
